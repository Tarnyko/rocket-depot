**Rocket Depot**

Rocket Depot is a simple graphical frontend for `rdesktop <http://www.rdesktop.org/>`_
and `FreeRDP <http://www.freerdp.com/>`_
with
support for connection profiles.  It runs on Linux desktops using GTK3 and
takes advantage of modern desktop environment features such as Unity
Quicklists.
    
**Supported RDP Clients**

Rocket Depot supports rdesktop and FreeRDP.  The Ubuntu package depends on rdesktop.  If you'd like to use FreeRDP, be aware that only the `new command-line interface <https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/CommandLineInterface>`_
is supported at this time.  To ensure compatibility, the `FreeRDP PPA <https://launchpad.net/~freerdp-team/+archive/freerdp>`_
is recommended if running Ubuntu, otherwise make sure your FreeRDP version is 1.0.1 or better.
